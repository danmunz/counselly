Counsel.ly
=========

A little prototype of how we might use HUD's housing counselor data (http://data.hud.gov/housing_counseling.html) to build a simple little mapping app.

Notes:
* While the counseling agencies & locations are all real, I just made up the services offered and languages spoken to have good dummy data
* Since I only grabbed a subset of counseling agencies, most are around the DC/NoVA area. You want to start with a location around there to get good results.
